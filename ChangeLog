2010-01-06 15:27 +0000 [r1083]  Sean Bright <sean@malleable.com>

	* formats/format_mp3.c: Fix reading samples from format_mp3 after
	  ast_seekstream/ast_tellstream. There is a bug when using
	  ast_seekstream/ast_tellstream with format_mp3 in that the file
	  read position is not reset before attempting to read samples. So
	  when we seek to determine the maximum size of the file (as in
	  res_agi's STREAM FILE) we weren't then resetting the file pointer
	  so that we could properly read samples. This patch addresses that
	  (in a similar manner to format_wav.c). (closes issue #15224)

	* formats/format_mp3.c: Fix audio problems with format_mp3. This
	  problem was introduced when the AST_FRIENDLY_OFFSET patch was
	  merged. I'm surprised that nobody noticed any trouble when
	  testing that patch, but this fixes the code that fills in the
	  buffer to start filling in after the offset portion of the
	  buffer. (closes issue #15850) Reported by: 99gixxer Patches:

	* formats/format_mp3.c: Fix memory corruption caused by format_mp3.
	  format_mp3 claimed that it provided AST_FRIENDLY_OFFSET in frames
	  returned by read(). However, it lied. This means that other parts
	  of the code that attempted to make use of the offset buffer would
	  end up corrupting the fields in the ast_filestream structure.
	  This resulted in quite a few crashes due to unexpected values for
	  fields in ast_filestream. This patch closes out quite a few bugs.
	  However, some of these bugs have been open for a while and have
	  been an area where more than one bug has been discussed. So with
	  that said, anyone that is following one of the issues closed
	  here, if you still have a problem, please open a new bug report
	  for the specific problem you are still having. If you do, please
	  ensure that the bug report is based on the newest version of
	  Asterisk, and that this patch is applied if format_mp3 is in use.
	  Thanks! (closes issue #15109) Reported by: jvandal Tested by:

	* Makefile.rules: Don't exclude system header files when doing
	  dependency checks. The reason for this is fairly obvious -- the
	  Asterisk header files (but only in -addons) are part of the
	  system header files at that point, so a changed buildopts.h is
	  considered a change in the system headers. We WANT that change to
	  be considered a reason to rebuild everything in -addons, since
	  the buildsum will no longer match at runtime. Note that if you're
	  building -addons, you'll still need to do a 'make clean' to get
	  the old dependency files to go away this first time, but after
	  that, the dependency checks will take care of it for you. (Closes
	  issue #11291)

	* asterisk-ooh323c/src/chan_h323.c: fix HOLD and UNHOLD control
	  frame processing to the ooh323 channel driver. The minimum thing
	  that every channel driver should do with these is start or stop
	  music on hold on the channel. Optionally, depending on the
	  channel, it may make sense to add configuration options to pass
	  this information down so that the remote end can handle the HOLD
	  signalling in the way that they choose. For example, chan_iax2
	  will pass this signalling across the network, and chan_zap will
	  pass this signalling on a PRI. (This fixes a problem I saw on the
	  asterisk-users mailing list)

	* asterisk-ooh323c/configure.in, asterisk-ooh323c/Makefile.am,
	  Makefile, aclocal.m4, build_tools/menuselect-deps.in, configure,
	  menuselect-tree, configure.ac, asterisk-ooh323c/configure,
	  format_mp3/Makefile, asterisk-ooh323c/Makefile.in, makeopts.in:
	  Add support for --with-asterisk to the configure script. This is
	  needed when you use --prefix in the asterisk installation. Issue
	  8492, patch by me.

	* Makefile: Clean up Makefile a little. Wildcard .o files - no need
	  to have different lines for each one. They were all the same.
	  Filter out modules that are in subdirectories, when doing mkdeps
	  - avoids a silly warning.
